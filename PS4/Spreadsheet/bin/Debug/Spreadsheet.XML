            an enumeration, without duplicates, of the names of all cells that contain
            formulas containing name.
            
            For example, suppose that
            A1 contains 3
            B1 contains the formula A1 * A1
            C1 contains the formula B1 + A1

            Requires that names be non-null.  Also requires that if names contains s,

            throws a CircularException.
            
            Otherwise, returns an enumeration of the names of all cells whose values must
            be recalculated, assuming that the contents of each cell named in names has changed.
            The names are enumerated in the order in which the calculations should be done.  
            
            For example, suppose that 
            A1 contains 5
            B1 contains 7
            C1 contains the formula A1 + B1
            D1 contains the formula A1 * C1
            E1 contains 15
            
            If A1 and B1 have changed, then A1, B1, and C1, and D1 must be recalculated,
            and they must be recalculated in either the order A1,B1,C1,D1 or B1,A1,C1,D1.
            The method will produce one of those enumerations.
            
            PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS METHOD DEPENDS ON THE ABSTRACT METHOD GetDirectDependents.
            IT WON'T WORK UNTIL GetDirectDependents IS IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY.
