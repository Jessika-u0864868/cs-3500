Need to fix my IsValidName method -- the REGEX doesn't work

Test3 - not sure what should happen - do I create a new cell with an empty string?
Tests 2, 5, 9, and 13 all fail because my REGEX doesn't work

Test27
Tests 31, 32, 33, 34 are all the same test
Tests 35, 36, 37, 38 are all the same test
Tests 43, 44, 45, 46 are all the same test

Notes:

For Spreadsheet:

- May want a variable to keep track of all non-empty cells
- Read message from Matt 

- do SetCellContents
- do GetDirectDependents first

For the Cell class, I want it to have the following properties:
	- String contents
	- String value
	- String row
	- String column
	- May want a data structure to keep track of dependents if a formula 
	- (or maybe just a 'name' for both row and column)
	- may want a helper variable to indicate if it is a string, double, or formula
	- String content_type: either a 'string'; a 'double'; or a 'Formula' or an empty string ""
	- Note: if the content_type is an empty string, we say the cell is empty
	- Note: cells are initialized to an empty string
	- String value_type can be either a 'string'; a 'double'; or a 'FormulaError'
	- If content_type = 'double' then value_type = 'double'
	- If content_type = 'string' then value_type = 'string'
	- If content_type = 'Formula' then value_type = 'double' or 'FormulaError' (Based on Evaluate method)
	- (the values of variables can also only be 'double' or 'undefined' if FormulaError since they reference other cell values)
	

One method return all its direct and indirect dependents - call the
prewritten method

Questions for TA:

X Do I wanted the Properties -> Build -> XML documentation file box checked
	for the Resources project? I wanted it checked for the others right?

X Where do I find my .dll files / which should I be adding to Resources -> Libraries?

X How do I fix my build errors?

X Is Override the correct syntax for relationship with abstract methods?

X Where do I comment the Recalculate method - in XML comments or in the method?

X SetCellContents calls?  Whats wrong with my cell class / overload constructor?

X What to do with Dependency Graph?

X GetAllNonEmpty Method - Check if any of cells are empty string - for the GetAllNonEmpty method

X ReferenceEquals the correct way to check if null?

X How to write a test for circular reference?

How to write a test for GetDirect Dependents?
