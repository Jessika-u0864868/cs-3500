Notes:

For Spreadsheet:

- May want a variable to keep track of all non-empty cells
- Read message from Matt 

- do SetCellContents
- do GetDirectDependents first

For the Cell class, I want it to have the following properties:
	- String contents
	- String value
	- String row
	- String column
	- May want a data structure to keep track of dependents if a formula 
	- (or maybe just a 'name' for both row and column)
	- may want a helper variable to indicate if it is a string, double, or formula
	- String content_type: either a 'string'; a 'double'; or a 'Formula' or an empty string ""
	- Note: if the content_type is an empty string, we say the cell is empty
	- Note: cells are initialized to an empty string
	- String value_type can be either a 'string'; a 'double'; or a 'FormulaError'
	- If content_type = 'double' then value_type = 'double'
	- If content_type = 'string' then value_type = 'string'
	- If content_type = 'Formula' then value_type = 'double' or 'FormulaError' (Based on Evaluate method)
	- (the values of variables can also only be 'double' or 'undefined' if FormulaError since they reference other cell values)
	

One method return all its direct and indirect dependents - call the
prewritten method

Questions for TA:

X Do I wanted the Properties -> Build -> XML documentation file box checked
	for the Resources project? I wanted it checked for the others right?

X Where do I find my .dll files / which should I be adding to Resources -> Libraries?

X How do I fix my build errors?

X Is Override the correct syntax for relationship with abstract methods?

Where do I comment the Recalculate method - in XML comments or in the method?

SetCellContents calls?  Whats wrong with my cell class / overload constructor?

What to do with Dependency Graph?
