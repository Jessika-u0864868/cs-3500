We decided to use the BoggleBoard class that was provided.

What do we do if there are exceptions? (see ReceiveWordCallback and other callbacks)?

I added string = string.ToUpper() before the PLAY and WORD parts - what do you think?
Also changed our REGEX to string.StartsWith()

Created a helper method for updating scores - not quite sure where to lock but I think it is
at the beginnin of this method

I created a Timer variables, and I think we may need to do stuff with it when we stop a game or return
to make sure the timer gets stopped.

Also added \n to our IGNORING BeginSend calls

Questions

How to read the dictionary file

Why is server.Stop() null? Do I need to dispose of resources here?

How do I add two StringSockets and join the server - is there a way
to access the console for each connection like SS.Console.WriteLine()?
