* What should I put in the Formula Errors - just a string "Formula Error"?

* Ask about how to end file extension - the DefaultExt and my loop to check for .sprd

Need to handle the following cases:

1. A cell references a cell with a formula error
A1 = 1/2
A2 = A1
change A1 = 1/0 - unhandled exception

2. A cell references a cell without a value
A2 = A1

* I also want to add functionality so that I can use arrow keys to move to different cells in the panel

Start of PS6. From PS5, I have added the grading tests and doneall necessary 
debugging so that my PS5 code passes all grading tests. 

In constructors, want to initialize new spreadsheets to make sure cell names are
valid, and make cells go to uppercase, and version = "ps6"

Implemented Change and Save methods. However, make sure to change the 'Save' method to write to 
the given file name rather than the Console. Also, when I do this I will need to take care of error
handling. Make sure to test for 'null' given as the file name and invalid file names. 

Still need to finish 4-arg constructor and getsaved version.  These will have similar error handling
for reading in the file I think, but also have extra checks as specified in the assigment.

So far I have spent roughly 2 hours reading the requirements and implementing the new constructors
required for PS5.

For the IsValid function -- didn't we already do that in the Formula class
	- do I need to change anything in the Formula class or only in Spreadsheet?
	- maybe in my cell constructor for Formulas I will need to pass in an IsValid param
	- same thing with Normalize delegate for Formula cells
How do I set up the 4 argument constructor?
	- does in need to extend my three argument constructor?
	- does in need to initializet he dictionary and dependency graph?
How do I read in a saved file?
	- make sure to throw SpreadsheetReadWriteException for errors
		- see specs for conditions on which to throw an error
How to fix my test cases?
	- do they need to all use the SetContentsOfCell method rather than the
	SetCellContents method from PS4? / after implementing the method
For GetCellValue, think about how to get the value of a formula from a cell
	- the cell will need to evaluate the formula 
	- how do I figure out the value of the variables
		- somehow I will have to pass in the dependency graph from the spreadsheet to the cell
For the Changed method, I should probably just use a boolean to keep track of changed conditions
Need to review how to write an XML file in a method (Save method) - go to office hours 
May possibly need a REGEX code for IsValid param for valid cells names
	- [a-z]+[1-9]+ should be the right code but double check

Notes:

For Spreadsheet:

- May want a variable to keep track of all non-empty cells
- Read message from Matt 

- do SetCellContents
- do GetDirectDependents first

For the Cell class, I want it to have the following properties:
	- String contents
	- String value
	- String row
	- String column
	- May want a data structure to keep track of dependents if a formula 
	- (or maybe just a 'name' for both row and column)
	- may want a helper variable to indicate if it is a string, double, or formula
	- String content_type: either a 'string'; a 'double'; or a 'Formula' or an empty string ""
	- Note: if the content_type is an empty string, we say the cell is empty
	- Note: cells are initialized to an empty string
	- String value_type can be either a 'string'; a 'double'; or a 'FormulaError'
	- If content_type = 'double' then value_type = 'double'
	- If content_type = 'string' then value_type = 'string'
	- If content_type = 'Formula' then value_type = 'double' or 'FormulaError' (Based on Evaluate method)
	- (the values of variables can also only be 'double' or 'undefined' if FormulaError since they reference other cell values)
	

One method return all its direct and indirect dependents - call the
prewritten method

Questions for TA:

X Do I wanted the Properties -> Build -> XML documentation file box checked
	for the Resources project? I wanted it checked for the others right?

X Where do I find my .dll files / which should I be adding to Resources -> Libraries?

X How do I fix my build errors?

X Is Override the correct syntax for relationship with abstract methods?

X Where do I comment the Recalculate method - in XML comments or in the method?

X SetCellContents calls?  Whats wrong with my cell class / overload constructor?

X What to do with Dependency Graph?

X GetAllNonEmpty Method - Check if any of cells are empty string - for the GetAllNonEmpty method

X ReferenceEquals the correct way to check if null?

X How to write a test for circular reference?

X How to write a test for GetDirect Dependents?

X Debugging for circular reference
