Questions:

When we update content in the view, do we need to make it thread safe?

-Do we need to try-catch in the Connect method? If so, what should be caught?
-In SendPlayerName, when we BeginSend, do we need a callback method to make sure
the player successfully connected? / and possibly an extra event to let the View 
know if the connection was successful?

One concern I have is that we are creating a new BoggleClientModel for each page. I don't think we 
should be doing this, but should instead have a single model for the entire game.



X-What to do with hostname? (and are we handling port correctly)
X-How to handle IP Address - is that the hostname

We decided to use the BoggleBoard class that was provided.

What do we do if there are exceptions? (see ReceiveWordCallback and other callbacks)?

I added string = string.ToUpper() before the PLAY and WORD parts - what do you think?
Also changed our REGEX to string.StartsWith()

Created a helper method for updating scores - not quite sure where to lock but I think it is
at the beginnin of this method

I created a Timer variables, and I think we may need to do stuff with it when we stop a game or return
to make sure the timer gets stopped.

Also added \n to our IGNORING BeginSend calls

Questions

X How to read the dictionary file

X For server.Stop() do I need to dispose of resources here? Getting an exception
because of the other thread running after close

How do I add two StringSockets and join the server - is there a way
to access the console for each connection like SS.Console.WriteLine()?

Are we locking in the right places?

currently we don't use allsockets or user_names - maybe we don't need them and just want to
keep track of all the Games?

in receiveWordsCallback, what do we do if the exception is not null - return?

How are the initial letters set up? Are they scrambled?
