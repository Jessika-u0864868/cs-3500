3. Describe the private member variables/properties that you will be using to support the operation of BeginSend 
in your StringSocket class.

5. Let s be a StringSocket.  Suppose that it the following three calls happen in quick succession from 
different threads:

s.BeginSend(string1, callback1, payload1);
s.BeginSend(string2, callback2, payload2);
s.BeginSend(string3, callback3, payload3);

Explain how your implementation will avoid intermingling the bytes of string1, string2, and string3 as 
they are being transmitted, and how it will decide when to invoke callback1, callback2, and callback3.
