3. Describe the private member variables/properties that you will be using to support the operation of BeginSend 
in your StringSocket class.

private Socket object and private Encoding object.

4. Describe the private member variables/properties that you will be using to support the operation of 
BeginReceive in your StringSocket class.

private Socket object and private Encoding object.

5. Let s be a StringSocket.  Suppose that it the following three calls happen in quick succession from 
different threads:

s.BeginSend(string1, callback1, payload1);
s.BeginSend(string2, callback2, payload2);
s.BeginSend(string3, callback3, payload3);

Explain how your implementation will avoid intermingling the bytes of string1, string2, and string3 as 
they are being transmitted, and how it will decide when to invoke callback1, callback2, and callback3.

6. Let s be a StringSocket.  Suppose that it the following three calls happen in quick succession from 
different threads:

s.BeginReceive(callback1, payload1);
s.BeginReceive(callback2, payload2);
s.BeginReceive(callback3, payload3);

Explain how your implementation will decide how and when to invoke callback1, callback2, and callback3.

7. Let s be a StringSocket.  Suppose that it the following two calls happen simultaneously on two 
different threads:

s.BeginSend(string1, callback1, payload1);
s.BeginSend(string2, callback2, payload2);

Explain how your implementation will prevent the two calls from interfering with each other.

Let s be a StringSocket.  Suppose that after the following call happens, a large number of bytes 
containing multiple newline characters arrive on the underlying socket.

s.BeginReceive(callback1, payload1);

Explain how your implementation will cope with the extra bytes.

If we already have a try/catch block in the SentBytes method do we need it in the SendComplete method since
it is kind of recursive??
